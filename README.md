## Overview

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI images as either showing the presence or absence of meningioma tumors. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by automating tumor detection and classification.

## Features

- **Binary Classification:** Differentiates between MRI scans with and without meningioma.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes normalization and augmentation for robust model training.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:

- [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
